# Interactive Fluid Simulation with React Three Fiber

A real-time, interactive fluid dynamics simulation built with React and React Three Fiber. This project showcases a high-poly glass-like ring that refracts 3D text behind it, combined with a fluid distortion effect that responds to mouse movement.

## üöÄ How It Works

This project leverages the power of the React Three Fiber ecosystem to create a stunning 3D scene in the browser. The core effects are achieved through a combination of advanced materials, post-processing, and 3D text rendering.

### Core Technologies

*   **React:** The foundation for the user interface.
*   **React Three Fiber (`@react-three/fiber`):** A powerful React renderer for Three.js, allowing us to build the 3D scene with declarative components.
*   **Drei (`@react-three/drei`):** A collection of essential helpers for React Three Fiber. We use it for the `<Text>`, `<Environment>`, and `<MeshTransmissionMaterial>`.
*   **React Postprocessing (`@react-three/postprocessing`):** Manages the post-processing effects, including the fluid simulation.
*   **Leva:** Provides the GUI controls for tweaking parameters in real-time.

### Key Components & Effects

1.  **The Glass Ring (`<ShinyRing />`)**
    *   **High-Poly Geometry:** The smooth ring shape is created using a `<torusGeometry>` with a high number of segments to ensure there are no visible low-poly edges.
    *   **Light-Bending Effect:** The glass material is a `<MeshTransmissionMaterial>` from `drei`. This advanced material realistically simulates light passing through a transparent object. The key property, `ior` (Index of Refraction), is set to a high value to create the strong, visible "light-bend" effect that distorts the text behind it.
    *   **Realistic Reflections:** The scene uses an `<Environment>` component loaded with a high-dynamic-range (HDR) image (`.hdr`). This studio light map provides the realistic, sharp reflections you see on the glass surface.

2.  **The 3D Text (`<SceneText />`)**
    *   The text is not a standard HTML element. It's a true 3D object rendered using the `<Text>` component from `drei`.
    *   It is strategically placed behind the glass ring in 3D space, allowing the ring's material to refract it.
    *   The text remains stationary while the ring rotates independently around it.

3.  **The Fluid Distortion**
    *   The interactive fluid effect comes from the `@whatisjery/react-fluid-distortion` library.
    *   It's applied as a **post-processing effect**, meaning it's a filter laid on top of the rendered scene. We use `<EffectComposer>` to manage this.
    *   Crucially, we use `<Selection>` and `<Select>` components. Only objects wrapped in `<Select enabled>` (in this case, the ring) are affected by the fluid distortion. This is how the text remains perfectly clear and is not distorted by the fluid effect.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Usage

To get this project running locally, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or later) and `npm` installed on your machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IMROVOID/React-Fluid-Distortion.git
cd React-Fluid-Distortion/client
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install all the required project dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run the Development Server

Start the local development server:

```bash
npm start
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the application running. The page will auto-reload when you make changes to the source code.

### 4. Build for Production

To create an optimized production build, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `build` folder in the `client` directory with all the static assets ready for deployment.

## üîß How to Modify

Customizing this project is straightforward. All the main logic is located in `client/src/App.js`.

### Change the Shape

1.  Navigate to the `<ShinyRing />` component.
2.  Modify the `<torusGeometry />` line. For example, to change it to a sphere, you could replace it with `<sphereGeometry args={[2, 128, 128]} />`.
3.  You can use any Three.js geometry you prefer.

### Adjust the Glass Effect

1.  Inside the `<ShinyRing />` component, find the `<MeshTransmissionMaterial />`.
2.  You can tweak its properties to change the glass appearance:
    *   `ior`: Controls the strength of the light-bending. Higher values mean more distortion.
    *   `roughness`: Makes the reflections sharper (lower values) or more diffuse (higher values).
    *   `envMapIntensity`: Controls the brightness of the HDR reflections.
    *   `color`: Change the tint of the glass.

### Change the Environment & Reflections

1.  In the `App` component, find the `<Environment />` tag.
2.  Change the `files` prop to a different `.hdr` file URL to get a completely different lighting and reflection style. You can find free HDRIs on sites like [Poly Haven](https://polyhaven.com/hdris).

### Modify the Text

1.  Go to the `<SceneText />` component.
2.  You'll find two `<Text>` components. You can change the content, `fontSize`, `color`, and other properties directly.

### Tweak the Fluid Effects

1.  At the top of the `App` component, you'll find several `useControls` hooks from the Leva library (e.g., `fluidConfigPrimary`).
2.  You can change the default values for `intensity`, `swirl`, `fluidColor`, etc., directly in the code. These are the same controls you see in the GUI.
